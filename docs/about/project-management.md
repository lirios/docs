# Project management

* GitHub issues on each repository for detailed issue tracking
* GitHub issues on the [lirios](https://github.com/lirios/lirios) repository for general issue tracking and tasks
* ZenHub for enhanced issue tracking with Scrum/Kanban approach
* Slack for team communication
* Google Groups mailing list
* Google Docs for big picture collaborative docs

# Decisions and conflict resolution

* Need to find a healthy way to resolve conflicts if we disagree
* Adapt governance model to the [Qt Governance Model](https://wiki.qt.io/The_Qt_Governance_Model)
* Use a contribution agreement that would allow us to relicense under another Free Software License blessed by OSI or FSF without contacting tons of people (I want to avoid this https://github.com/papyros/qml-material/issues/361) We won’t ask for copyright assignment and under no circumstances we’ll be able to make the code proprietary.

# Versioning

* Use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
* Liri OS MVP will start at version 0.9.0 since the shell and workspace code comes directly from Hawaii that reached 0.8.0
* How do we version all the libraries, etc? Do we use the same version for each project and release everything at once?
