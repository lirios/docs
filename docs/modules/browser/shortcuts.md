# Shortcuts

Liri Browser is using Qt's [magic][qt-doc-standardkey] to offer platform independent keyboard shortcuts.
However, this is a list of shortcuts which should work on all platforms:

| Action    | Shortcut    |
|-----------|-------------|
| New tab   | Ctrl+T      |
| Close tab | Ctrl+W      |
| Focus tab | Alt+[0...9] |
| Back      | Alt+Left    |
| Forward   | Alt+Right   |
| Focus url | Ctrl+L      |
| Refresh   | F5          |
| Stop      | Esc         |
